# This script is intentionally NOT active. It will not run on any tool
# call until you re-add it to .claude/settings.json under
# hooks.PreToolUse[*].hooks where the matcher is "Bash":
#
#   { "type": "command",
#     "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/guards/git-guardrails.sh" }
#
# Disabled on 2026-04-27 because it interfered with explicit push and PR
# creation flows during template development. Re-enable per-project once
# the workflow tolerates a manual-only push policy.

# Blocks (in addition to bash-guard.sh which covers --force/--hard/clean):
#   - git push (any variant) — let the user push manually
#   - git branch -D / --delete -f
#   - git checkout . / git restore . / git checkout -- .
#
# Rationale: prompts cannot reliably enforce git safety; only the harness can.
# When blocked, Claude sees a message and stops — the user runs the command
# manually if intended.
