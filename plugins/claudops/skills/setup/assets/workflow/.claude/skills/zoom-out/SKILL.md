  Step up one layer of abstraction and produce a map of the relevant modules

# Zoom Out

> **Upstream**: Adapted from [mattpocock/skills/zoom-out](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/zoom-out/SKILL.md).

Step out of the current file. Go up one layer of abstraction. Produce a compact map of:

- The **modules** in this area (use `architecture-language/LANGUAGE.md` vocabulary)
- Their **callers** — who reaches into this code and from where
- Their **dependencies** — what this code reaches into

Do not propose changes. Do not deep-dive into any one module. The point is to recover bearings, not to solve a problem.

If this supports an active task, use [`../setup/references/task-context.md`](../setup/references/task-context.md)
to read the selected task's relevant links. Do not create a task or artifact for a standalone map.

If `product-docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` exists, name modules using its terms when possible.
