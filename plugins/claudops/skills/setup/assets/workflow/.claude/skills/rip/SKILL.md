# Review Implementation Plan (RIP)

Step-by-step review of implementation plan. Focus: **business value** through technical understanding.

Resolve the plan and related inputs with
[`../setup/references/task-context.md`](../setup/references/task-context.md). This is an optional
read-only walkthrough after planning; it does not create a second plan or task.

## Protocol

### Phase 1: Analysis

Before responding:
1. Read the resolved active plan completely. If the argument is a directory or ambiguous path, use
   the task resolver and Glob for plan-shaped files (`tech-decomposition-*.md`, `*implementation-plan*.md`)
   before asking the user to choose.
2. Study related code (Grep, Read) — verify, don't assume. Never comment on a file you have not opened; if the plan names a file, read it before evaluating the step that touches it.
3. Compare with PRD/business requirements — run alignment checklist:
   - Measurable outcomes/KPIs defined?
   - Scope matches PRD (no creep, no gaps)?
   - Risks or dependencies identified?
   - Each step ties to a user-facing outcome?
4. Determine business value of each step
5. If an ambiguity or missing context would change the review, use AskUserQuestion to clarify; otherwise state the review assumption and continue.

Record mismatches (extra features, missed requirements, logic conflicts) for discussion. Frame each as **facts + question** rather than a verdict — the plan author knows the product context you don't, and a question invites a fix instead of a defense.

**Review format:**

```
## Overview

**Business goal:** [what problem it solves]
**Scope:** [components] | [files] | [complexity]
**Plan:** [N steps with names]

**Warnings (include uncertain ones with confidence tag):**
- [Problem] — contradicts [source]

Begin the walkthrough after the overview unless a material ambiguity needs user input.
```

### Phase 2: Walkthrough

Default to a continuous walkthrough in one response (all steps, back-to-back) — 4.7 calibrates length well and one message is cheaper than N turns. Pause only when (a) the user asks you to pause, (b) you need to resolve a PRD mismatch before the next step makes sense, or (c) the plan has more than ~6 steps and a mid-review check-in improves comprehension.

**Step format:**

```
### Step [N]: [Name]

**Why:** [business reason]
**What:** [technical essence]
**Concepts:** [term]: [analogy]
**Impact:** [code] → [user-facing change]
**Code:** [if relevant]

**Warnings (include uncertain ones with confidence tag):**
- [PRD issue]
- **Question:** [clarification]

```

### Phase 3: Summary

```
## Summary

**Covered:** [recap]
**Value:** [why it matters to user]
**Concepts:** [list]

**Self-check:**
1. [Business question]
2. [Technical question]
```

## Rules

| Principle | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Business-first | Start with "why for the user" |
| Simplicity | Term = analogy |
| Specificity | Real files/endpoints |
| Progress | Every 3-4 steps: "X of N" |
| Criticality | Surface every potential PRD mismatch, including uncertain ones; mark each with confidence (high/medium/low). Present them all in the Warning block — let the user decide what is in scope. |
| Constructiveness | Facts + question, no dismissiveness |

## Example

**Input:** Progress tracking plan

**Overview:**

> **Business goal:** Users see progress → motivation
> **Scope:** backend + DB | `src/modules/progress/` | medium
> **Plan:** 4 steps (model, API, logic, integration)
>
> **Warning:**
> - Plan doesn't mention visualization — PRD requires charts. Out of scope?
> - PRD: PDF export — not in plan. Include?

**Step 1:**

> **Why:** Store word learning history
> **What:** `WordProgress` table links user+word, stores metrics
> **Concepts:** Database schema = DB blueprint as code
> **Impact:** "Progress" screen → word-level stats
>
> **Warning:**
> - PRD: track repetition intervals (spaced repetition). Schema: only `lastSeen`, no history.
> - **Question:** Plan — current state only or full history?

## Completion

The review is complete when every plan step has been walked through, each material mismatch
or uncertainty is recorded with a confidence tag and a question, and the summary self-check is
present. This is a read-only review; a warning or a user checkpoint does not authorize plan or
code edits.
