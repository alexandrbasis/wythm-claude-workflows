description: Interactive QA session where the user reports bugs conversationally and the agent files them as tracker issues
  (GitHub or Linear) one by one or as a dependency-linked breakdown. Explores the codebase in the background for context and
  domain language. Use when user wants to "do QA", "report bugs", "file issues from a QA pass", or runs through multiple problems
  at once. NOT for single-bug triage (use /triage-issue) or interactive debug (/dbg).

> If `.claude/skills/qa/SKILL.md.disabled` exists, stop before reading a fallback.
> **Project configuration:** If the current project contains `.claude/skills/qa/SKILL.md`, read and apply it instead of this bundled default. The project copy is the capability source of truth.
> **Repository context:** Read `../setup/references/task-context.md` when resolving a task, project commands, or legacy `.claude/` resource paths. Use repository evidence and optional `CLAUDOPS.md`; a missing local workflow copy does not require setup. Resolve bundled resources from the installed skill, never from the target cwd.

# QA Session

> **Upstream**: Adapted from [mattpocock/skills/qa](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/qa/SKILL.md). Adapted to use this repo's `Explore` agent, `cc-linear`/`gh` integration, and `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` convention.

Run an interactive QA session. The user describes problems they're encountering. You clarify lightly, explore the codebase for context, and file tracker issues that are durable, user-focused, and use the project's domain language. **No fixes applied.**

Resolve the task with `../setup/references/task-context.md` before the first issue. Reuse an existing
task or create the minimum record in the configured root; for an audit/draft-only request, return the
proposed path without writing. Link each issue, evidence, current state, and next action from the
session/task record. The user's explicit QA request remains the authorization for tracker writes in
the selected destination.

A request to run QA or file the reported bugs authorizes issue creation in the tracker selected
for this session. If the user asks only for an audit, summary, or draft bodies, stop before the
tracker write. Resolve the repository/team destination before the first issue and keep it fixed
for the session.

## Pick the tracker once, at the start

Detect Linear (look for `cc-linear` config / `LINEAR_TEAM_ID` / Linear references in recent issues) vs GitHub Issues. If ambiguous, ask once: `AskUserQuestion`: "File via Linear or GitHub Issues for this session?" — then keep that choice for the whole session.

## For each issue the user raises

### 1. Listen and lightly clarify

Let the user describe the problem in their own words. Ask **at most 2-3 short clarifying questions**:

- What they expected vs what actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (if not obvious)
- Whether it's consistent or intermittent

Do NOT over-interview. If the description is clear enough to file, move on.

### 2. Explore the codebase in the background

While the user describes the next issue, optionally kick off an `Agent` (subagent_type=Explore) for the previous one. Goal is **not** to fix — it's to:

- Learn the domain language used in that area (cross-check with `product-docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` if it exists)
- Understand what the feature is supposed to do
- Identify the user-facing behavior boundary

Context helps you write a better issue. The issue itself must NOT reference specific files, line numbers, or internal implementation details.

### 3. Assess scope: single issue or breakdown?

Before filing, decide whether this is a **single issue** or a **breakdown** into multiple issues.

**Break down** when:

- The fix spans multiple independent areas (e.g., "form validation is wrong AND success message is missing AND redirect is broken")
- There are clearly separable concerns that different people/agents could work on in parallel
- The user describes multiple distinct failure modes or symptoms

**Keep as a single issue** when:

- It's one behavior wrong in one place
- The symptoms all stem from the same root behavior

### 4. File the issue(s)

Use `gh issue create` or invoke `/cc-linear` (whichever was picked at the start). **Do NOT ask the user to review first** — file and share URLs. If the create operation fails, report the failure and do not claim that an issue was filed.

#### Single-issue template

```
## What happened

[Actual behavior the user experienced, in plain language]

## What I expected

[Expected behavior]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Concrete numbered steps a developer can follow]
2. [Use domain terms from UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md, not internal module names]
3. [Include relevant inputs, flags, or configuration]

## Additional context

[Extra observations from the user or from background exploration —
e.g. "this only happens in the Docker layer, not the filesystem layer".
Use domain language; do not cite files.]
```

#### Breakdown template (per sub-issue)

```
## Parent

#<parent-issue-number> (if a tracking issue was created) or "Reported during QA session"

## What's wrong

[This specific behavior problem — just this slice, not the whole report]

## What I expected

[Expected behavior for this slice]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Steps specific to THIS issue]

## Blocked by

- #<issue-number> (if this issue can't be fixed until another is resolved)

Or "None — can start immediately" if no blockers.

## Additional context

[Observations relevant to this slice]
```

When creating a breakdown:

- **Prefer many thin issues over few thick ones** — each independently fixable and verifiable
- **Mark blocking relationships honestly** — if B genuinely can't be tested until A is fixed, say so. If they're independent, mark both as "None — can start immediately"
- **Create issues in dependency order** so you can reference real issue numbers in "Blocked by"
- **Maximize parallelism** — multiple people / `/si` runs should be able to grab different issues simultaneously

### 5. Rules for all issue bodies

- **No file paths or line numbers** — they go stale
- **Use the project's domain language** (check `product-docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` if it exists)
- **Describe behaviors, not code** — "the sync service fails to apply the patch", not "applyPatch() throws on line 42"
- **Reproduction steps are mandatory** — if you can't determine them, ask the user once
- **Keep it concise** — a developer should be able to read the issue in 30 seconds

After filing, link each issue URL (with blocker relationships summarized) from the selected task record,
then ask: "Next issue, or are we done?"

### 6. Continue the session

Keep going until the user says they're done. Each issue is independent — don't batch them.

## Distinction from sibling skills

| Skill | Mode | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `/dbg` | Interactive single-bug debug, may fix | Fixed bug or hypothesis |
| `/triage-issue` | Single bug → root cause + TDD plan, no fix | One tracker issue |
| `/qa` | Multiple bugs reported conversationally, no fix | Multiple tracker issues, possibly with blocker links |

## Completion

For each reported bug, finish with either the created issue URL and its blocker relationships,
or an explicit creation failure. Keep asking for the next issue until the user says the session
is done; a code exploration or drafted issue body is not a filed issue.
