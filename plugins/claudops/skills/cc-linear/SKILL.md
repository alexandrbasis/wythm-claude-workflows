description: 'Execute Linear operations via direct GraphQL API — create issues, update status/priority/title, add comments,
  search tasks, manage labels, assign work, and link PRs. Use this skill when the user mentions Linear explicitly, or references
  a Linear-style identifier (uppercase team prefix + dash + number, e.g. ENG-123, OPS-7; the project''s team key is in $LINEAR_TEAM_KEY).
  Trigger on phrases like "create a Linear ticket/issue", "move TEAM-X to done/in progress/review", "update the Linear task
  status", "close the Linear issue", "what''s in our Linear backlog", "assign this Linear issue to", "my Linear issues", or
  any project management operation targeting Linear. Also trigger when other skills (ct, si, sr) need to sync state with Linear.
  Do not trigger on ambiguous "create an issue" when the user clearly means a GitHub Issue (repo context, `gh issue` commands,
  issues.md), unless they also reference Linear.

# CC Linear

> Prefix the first response in a session with a one-line tag: `[cc-linear]`.

Interact with Linear via the configured `linear-api.sh` wrapper — a direct `curl` wrapper
over Linear's GraphQL API. Resolve the wrapper from the active project override or the
loaded skill/package; do not assume that a plugin is copied into the target repository.
Read `../setup/references/task-context.md` when the operation advances a task. A
standalone lookup or explicitly requested Linear operation does not create a fake task.
The relative `.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh` paths in examples describe a copied
workflow; substitute the resolved wrapper path before execution.

## Commands

### Issues
```bash
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh get-issue TEAM-66
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh search "authentication" 5
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh ai-search "error handling in mobile app" 5
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh create-issue "Title" "Description" 3
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh create-issue "Title" "-" 3 <<< "Multiline desc"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh update-issue TEAM-66 --title "New Title"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh update-issue TEAM-66 --description "New desc"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh update-issue TEAM-66 --priority 2
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh update-status TEAM-66 "In Progress"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh add-comment TEAM-66 "Comment body"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh add-comment TEAM-66 "-" <<'EOF'
Multiline comment here
EOF
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh list-comments TEAM-66
```

Use `"-"` as the body argument to read from stdin — preferred for any
description or comment longer than one line or containing quotes.

### Labels, Assignment & Relations
```bash
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh add-label TEAM-66 "Bug"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh remove-label TEAM-66 "Bug"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh assign TEAM-66 "<configured-user>"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh add-relation TEAM-66 TEAM-67 "blocks"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh link-pr TEAM-66 "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"
```

### Listings & Queries
```bash
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh list-issues 10
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh my-issues                    # Current user's active issues
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh my-issues 20                 # With custom limit
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh list-states
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh list-labels
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh list-users
```

## Output Formatting

The script returns raw JSON. Present results to the user clearly:

- **get-issue**: Show identifier, title, status, priority, assignee, labels, and URL
- **search / ai-search**: Numbered list with identifier, title, and status
- **create-issue**: Confirm with identifier and URL
- **update-status / update-issue**: Confirm the change (e.g., "TEAM-66: Todo → In Progress")
- **list-comments**: Show author, date, and body for each comment
- **my-issues**: Show as a compact table grouped by status
- **list-***: Show as a compact table

Include the Linear URL in every issue response — the user will want to click
through.

## Before Acting

Linear mutations are visible to the whole team and send notifications. Before
running any of these commands, state what visible change is about to happen and
confirm it unless the user or calling workflow already authorized that exact
destination and scope in this task. Existing authorization covers the remaining
commands in the same chain; do not ask again between dependent steps:

- `create-issue`, `add-comment`, `add-relation`, `link-pr` (new visible content)
- `update-status`, `update-issue`, `assign`, `add-label`, `remove-label` (state changes)

Read-only commands (`get-issue`, `search`, `ai-search`, `list-*`, `my-issues`)
do not need confirmation — run them freely.

For multi-step patterns below, confirm the whole chain once, then execute
without re-prompting between steps.

Before creating an issue, search the intended team for duplicates and confirm the
team/state/label names. Before updating an issue that is not already established in
context, read it first. Then run one narrow mutation and independently read back the
resulting object before reporting it. Match the read-back to the mutation:

- `create-issue`, `update-issue`, `update-status`, `add-label`, `remove-label`, and `assign`:
  read the affected issue with `get-issue` (use the identifier returned by `create-issue`).
- `add-comment`: read the issue's comments with `list-comments`; `get-issue` omits comments.
- `add-relation` and `link-pr`: this wrapper has no matching read command, so report the
  mutation receipt and say independent verification is unavailable rather than treating the
  mutation response as a read-back.

The mutation's JSON response can help diagnose failure, but it is not the independent
read-back.

## Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Team Key | Explicit `LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` or a read-only discovered team confirmed before mutation |
| API Key | `LINEAR_API_KEY` env var |

The legacy wrapper may retain a `TEAM` fallback for compatibility; the skill must not
use that fallback for a visible mutation without resolving and confirming the destination.

### Example states (query the configured workspace before mutation)

```
Backlog → Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done | Canceled | Duplicate
```

### Priority Levels

```
0: None  1: Urgent  2: High  3: Normal (default)  4: Low
```

## Workflow Patterns

Common multi-step sequences. Each command is atomic. When the steps have no
dependency on each other (e.g. adding a label and assigning at the same time),
batch them in a single turn; run sequentially only when a later step needs
output from an earlier one.

### Start Implementation
```bash
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh update-status TEAM-66 "In Progress"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh add-comment TEAM-66 "Implementation started. Branch: feature/team-66-feature-name"
```

### Submit for Review
```bash
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh update-status TEAM-66 "In Review"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh add-comment TEAM-66 "-" <<'EOF'
Implementation completed.
- Key changes: [list]
- Test coverage: [X]%
- PR ready for review.
EOF
```

### Task Done
```bash
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh update-status TEAM-66 "Done"
.claude/scripts/linear-api.sh add-comment TEAM-66 "Task completed and PR merged. SHA: abc123"
```

## Cross-Skill Integration

When other skills touch Linear-adjacent work, offer the matching Linear
operation as a suggestion — do not run it unprompted. Only execute when the
user agrees or when the outer skill explicitly delegates to you.

| Skill | When | Linear Action |
|-------|------|---------------|
| `/ct` | After creating task docs | `create-issue` with task title + link to task doc |
| `/si` | On implementation start | `update-status` → "In Progress" + comment with branch |
| `/sr` | After code review passes | `update-status` → "In Review" or "Done" |
| PR creation | After `gh pr create` | `link-pr` + `update-status` → "In Review" |

Don't force these — suggest them when the context is clear (e.g., a TEAM-* ID is visible
in the resolved task or branch). Record issue ID/URL, mutation receipt and matching
read-back in that task when one exists; standalone operations return their own receipt.

## Error Recovery

- If a command fails mid-sequence, retry the failed command — completed steps are idempotent.
- If "State not found", run `list-states` to refresh the cache, then retry.
- If "Label/User not found", run `list-labels` or `list-users` to check exact names.
- Clear all caches: `rm /tmp/linear-TEAM-*.json`
- Report command failures (non-zero exits, GraphQL errors) to the user with the
  exact error message — don't retry hidden.
