### Command Integration

Each command is designed to work seamlessly with the others and specialized sub-agents:

1. **Linear Integration**: All commands use **linear-task-manager agent** for consistent Linear issue updates
2. **Task Documentation**: Commands maintain **single technical decomposition** as source of truth, with optional JTBD/PRD for context
3. **Git Integration**: Commands handle branch creation, commits, and PR management
4. **Sub-Agent Coordination**: Commands orchestrate specialized agents for quality validation
5. **Quality Gates**: Each stage has validation criteria before proceeding to next stage
6. **TDD-First**: Test plans created and approved before implementation begins

### Best Practices

#### Command Sequencing
- **Optional: Start with `/cjtbd`**: Analyze user needs for complex features
- **Optional: Continue with `/cprd`**: Define product requirements
- **Required: Use `ct`**: Create technical decomposition for implementation
- **Implement with `si`**: Use Start Implementation for executing approved tasks
- **Handle handoffs with `ph`**: Use Prepare Handover when implementation needs to pause
- **Continue with `si`**: Resume implementation work using the same Start Implementation command
- **Review with `sr` or `asr`**: Always conduct code review before merging
- **Merge with `mp`**: Use Merge PR for final integration and documentation
- **Fix CI with `fci`**: Address any post-merge CI failures immediately

#### Implementation Flow Options
**Full Product Flow**: `/cjtbd` → `/cprd` → `ct` → `si` → `sr`/`asr` → `mp` → (`fci` if needed)

**Standard Flow**: `ct` → `si` → `sr` → `mp` → (`fci` if needed)
