# Changelog Generator

**Purpose**: Generate changelog entries from completed task documents and update date-based changelog files

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Read the completed task’s technical decomposition, extract the implemented changes, and add a structured changelog entry to the date-based files under `docs/changelogs/`.

## INPUT
- **Task Document**: `tasks/task-YYYY-MM-DD-[feature]/tech-decomposition-[feature].md`
- **Source Sections**: `Primary Objective`, `Implementation Steps`, and especially `## Implementation Changelog`
- **Target Directory**: `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/` (create if missing)
- **Target File**: `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/changelog.md`

## CHANGELOG FORMAT
Follow Keep a Changelog format for daily entries:
```markdown
# Changelog - YYYY-MM-DD

All notable changes made on YYYY-MM-DD are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Changes Made

### Added
- New feature descriptions

### Changed
- Modified functionality descriptions

### Fixed
- Bug fix descriptions

### Removed
- Deprecated feature removals
```

## WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Determine Current Date and Directory
- Get current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format using `date +%Y-%m-%d` (or accept explicit date from the invoking command)
- Create the directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Set target file path to `docs/changelogs/YYYY-MM-DD/changelog.md`

### Step 2: Analyze Task Document
- Read the `tech-decomposition-*.md` file to understand what was implemented
- Focus on the `## Implementation Changelog` and completion summary for file paths, timestamps, and user impact
- Gather references to acceptance criteria, database changes, and tests that were executed
- Identify change type: Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed

### Step 3: Categorize Changes
Based on the task content, categorize as:
- **Added**: New features, commands, entities, or migrations
- **Changed**: Modified behavior, refactors, docs updates
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes, regression patches
- **Removed**: Deprecated features, cleanup, migration rollbacks

### Step 4: Handle Existing vs New Changelog
- **If changelog.md exists**: Append to the existing “Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed” sections
- **If changelog.md doesn't exist**: Create the file with the standard header before adding entries
- Preserve existing entries when updating
- Maintain proper markdown formatting and structure

### Step 5: Generate and Insert Changelog Entry
- Write clear, user-focused descriptions with code references from the task’s changelog (e.g., ``backend/src/modules/sessions/services/create-session.service.ts``)
- Include folder references for broader changes (e.g., ``backend/src/modules/sessions/``, ``backend/tests/integration/``)
- Mention test coverage or migrations if the task highlighted them
- Add entries to the appropriate section (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed) in the date-specific file

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT
For a task about adding user authentication completed on 2025-09-27:

**Target File**: `docs/changelogs/2025-09-27/changelog.md`

```markdown
### Added
- User authentication system with login/logout commands (`src/handlers/auth.py:12-45`, `src/models/user.py:78`)
- Secure session management for bot users (`src/services/session.py`, `src/utils/security.py:23`)
- Role-based access control for admin features (`src/middleware/auth.py:56-89`, `src/models/`)
```

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE MANAGEMENT
Create directories on demand; a minimal structure looks like:
```
docs/changelogs/
├── 2025-11-20/
│   └── changelog.md
└── 2025-11-21/
    └── changelog.md
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Changelog entry accurately reflects task implementation
- User-focused language explaining impact with technical context
- Code references include specific file paths and line numbers where applicable
- Folder references used for broader structural changes
- Proper categorization and formatting
- Date-specific changelog file created/updated in correct directory structure
- Directory created if it doesn't exist for the current date
- Existing entries preserved when updating an existing date's changelog
