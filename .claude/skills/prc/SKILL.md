# PR Review Comments Handler

> **Announcement**: Begin with: "I'm using the **prc** skill for PR comment resolution."

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Fetch, analyze, and address code review comments on the current PR. Present an action plan for user approval before implementing fixes, then commit and reply to reviewers.

## Related Skills

- `/sr` — Initiate a code review (before merge). Use that skill to start a review, this skill to address the results.
- `/si` — Task-based implementation with "Address CR" mode. Use `/si` when review feedback requires structured task-driven changes; use `/prc` for direct, ad-hoc PR comment handling.

## GATE 1: Identify PR & Fetch Comments

### Step 1: Resolve PR

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a PR number, use it. Otherwise:

1. Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch
2. Run `gh pr view --json number,title,url` to find the open PR

**Error — no PR found:**
Inform user: "No open PR found for branch `{branch}`. Verify the branch is pushed and the PR is open." Stop execution.

### Step 2: Fetch Comments

1. Run `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews` to get reviews
2. Run `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments` to get inline comments
3. Also check `gh pr view {pr_number} --json comments` for general PR comments

**Error — no comments found:**
Inform user: "No review comments found on PR #{number}. Nothing to address." Stop execution.

---

## GATE 2: Analyze & Present Plan

### Step 1: Categorize Comments

List **every** comment fetched in Gate 1 — do not drop any. Reviewer noise, nits, and resolved threads all appear in the plan so the user sees what was received.

For each comment, evaluate:
- Is the feedback valid and technically correct?
- Is it applicable to the current code?
- Does it align with project conventions and architecture?
- Is it a blocker or a nice-to-have suggestion?

For each comment, propose one of:
- **Address** — Valid feedback, will fix.
- **Skip** — Not applicable, already handled, or nit you recommend ignoring. Always include a one-line reason so the user can override.
- **Discuss** — Ambiguous, contested, or would change scope — escalate to user.

When in doubt between Address and Skip, pick Discuss. The user decides in Gate 2 whether to drop it.

### Step 2: Present Action Plan

Display a table:

```
| # | File:Line | Comment Summary | Action | Complexity |
|---|-----------|-----------------|--------|------------|
| 1 | src/foo.ts:42 | Missing null check | Address | Simple |
| 2 | src/bar.ts:15 | Rename variable | Address | Simple |
| 3 | src/baz.ts:88 | Architecture concern | Discuss | Significant |
```

Before implementing anything, confirm the plan with AskUserQuestion. Ask the user to approve, edit, or flag items they disagree with — including items you marked Skip. Implementation starts only after approval.

## GATE 3: Implement & Verify

### Step 1: Apply Fixes

For each approved "Address" item:
1. Read the target file
2. Make the necessary code change using Edit
3. Track progress with TodoWrite

For "Discuss" items the user resolved: apply the agreed-upon fix.

### Step 2: Run Verification

1. Run project tests (`npm test` or equivalent)
2. Run lint checks (`{{LINT_CMD}}` or equivalent)
3. Run type checks if applicable (`tsc --noEmit`)

**Error — tests or lint fail:**
Present failures to user. Work with user to resolve, or revert changes if needed before moving to GATE 4.

---

## GATE 4: Commit, Push & Reply

### Step 1: Commit & Push

1. Stage changed files with `git add` (specific files only)
2. **Ask user permission** before committing
3. Create a focused commit: `fix: address PR review feedback`
4. Ask for explicit push authorization unless the user's request already authorizes pushing, then push to update the PR

### Step 2: Reply to Comments

Prepare a reply draft for each addressed comment:
- Describe what was done in 1–2 sentences
- Include the target comment and the verification result

Send replies only when the user explicitly requested reviewer communication or approves the prepared
reply set. A code-fix request alone authorizes the local change, not external messages.

For skipped comments:
- Draft a respectful explanation; send it under the same explicit communication gate

**Error — gh API reply fails:**
Report the error and suggest manual reply via GitHub UI.
