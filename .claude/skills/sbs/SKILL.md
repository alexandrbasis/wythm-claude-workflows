  Interactive teaching guide for learning while working. Use when asked to
  'teach me', 'walk me through', 'explain step by step', 'guide me through',
  'show me how', 'learn while doing', 'I want to understand', 'help me learn',
  'can you explain how', 'what does this do and why', or when the user expresses
  desire to understand a topic deeply rather than just get a quick answer. Also
  trigger when the user wants to learn a new tool, library, pattern, or workflow
  hands-on — even if they don't use the word "teach". NOT for open-ended
  brainstorming (use /brainstorm), NOT for quick one-off explanations (just
  answer directly), NOT for debugging (use /dbg).

# Step-by-Step Learning Guide

> **Announcement**: Begin with: "I'm using the **sbs** skill for interactive step-by-step teaching."

## SCOPE
- **Use for:** Teaching any task interactively — "teach me", "walk me through", "explain step by step", "I want to understand how X works", "show me how to do Y"
- **Route elsewhere when:**
  - The user wants to explore possibilities without a concrete topic → `/brainstorm`
  - The user wants a task doc produced, not learning → `/ct`
  - The user has a failing thing to fix, not a concept to learn → `/dbg`
  - The question is one-off and factual → answer directly, don't start a session

## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Guide the user through their requested task as an interactive teacher, explaining each step clearly while building genuine understanding — not just completing work. The user should walk away able to repeat and adapt what they learned, not just follow a recipe.

## ARGUMENT VALIDATION

**If no `[topic]` argument provided:**
1. Use `AskUserQuestion`: "What would you like to learn about?"
   - For a project-specific topic, scan recent `git log --oneline -5` and `tasks/` for contextual suggestions; for a general topic, skip repository discovery
   - Offer 2-3 relevant suggestions based on recent project activity
   - Include a free-text option

## RESUME CHECK

Before starting a new session, check for existing learning notes:
1. Search for `docs/learning/sbs-*-[topic-slug].md`
2. If found:
   - Read the existing document
   - `AskUserQuestion`: "Found notes from a previous session on this topic."
     Options: "Continue where we left off" / "Start fresh" / "Review notes first"
   - **Continue**: identify which sections are complete, pick up from where the user left off
   - **Start fresh**: proceed with full workflow
   - **Review**: present existing notes, then ask what to expand on

## SESSION SETUP

Use AskUserQuestion to calibrate three things:

1. **Experience level** — "How familiar are you with [topic area]?"
   - Beginner (no prior experience)
   - Some experience (done similar things before)
   - Experienced (just unfamiliar with this specific area)

2. **Teaching mode** — "How would you like to learn?"
   - **Guided execution** (default) — I explain each step, you execute it
   - **Socratic mode** — I ask questions to help you figure out each step yourself

3. **Session depth** — "How deep should we go?"
   - **Quick walkthrough** — "Just show me the key steps" (5-10 min, 3-5 steps, lightweight)
   - **Full tutorial** — "I want to really understand this" (15-30 min, structured learning with context)
   - **Deep mastery** — "I want to be able to teach this to someone else" (30+ min, with exercises and edge cases)

Adapt explanation depth, step count, and questioning style based on responses.

## CODEBASE INTEGRATION

Teaching is more effective when grounded in real code the user is working with.

**When the topic relates to this project's code:**
1. Use Glob/Grep to find relevant files before explaining
2. Use actual code snippets from the codebase as teaching examples — real code beats contrived examples
3. Reference real file paths (with line numbers) so the user can follow along in their editor
4. Connect concepts to existing patterns already in the codebase ("Notice how `SessionService` already uses this pattern...")

**When the topic is general (not project-specific):**
- Skip codebase exploration
- Use self-contained examples
- Still reference project conventions when relevant ("In this project, we'd do it like...")

## RESEARCH (When Needed)

If the topic involves a library, API, or pattern that needs verification:
- Reach for `get_code_context_exa` when you are about to cite a specific
  API shape or library behaviour that you can't verify from the
  codebase. Skip it for concepts the user already knows.
- Reach for `web_search_exa` when current practice may have shifted
  (post-2024 library guidance, framework defaults). Skip it for
  stable, well-documented topics.
- Cite sources when sharing external knowledge — accuracy matters in teaching

This ensures the teaching is current and correct. Confidently-stated wrong information is worse than saying "let me look that up."

## TEACHING PROTOCOL

### Core Teaching Principles
- One step at a time. Present the current step only — jumping ahead hides
  the action the user is meant to execute themselves.
- Explain before action. The rationale makes the mechanics stick; a
  recipe without the why doesn't transfer.
- Confirm understanding. Ask at the end of each step before moving on.
- Learn by doing. The user runs each action — you guide, not execute.
- Ground in reality. Prefer real code from this project to contrived
  examples; the user will recognise it again later.

### Step Structure — Guided Execution (default)
For EACH step, follow this format:

```
### Step [N]: [Clear Action Title]

**What we're doing:** Purpose, calibrated to session depth
(Quick: one sentence. Full: 2–3 sentences with a bit of context.
Deep: include what this replaces or competes with.)
**Why this matters:** [How this fits the bigger picture]
**Technical concept:** [Simple explanation of new concepts — skip if no new concept]
**Your action:** [Specific instruction with code blocks]
**What to expect:** [Expected outcome after completion]
```

End each step with AskUserQuestion: "Step [N] complete?" with options: "Done, next step" / "I have a question" / "Something went wrong".

### Step Structure — Socratic Mode
When user chose Socratic mode, replace **Your action** with guided questions:

```
### Step [N]: [Clear Action Title]

**Context:** [Brief setup for what we're working on]
**Think about it:** [1-2 questions to guide the user toward the solution]
  - e.g., "What command would you use to...?" or "Where do you think this config lives?"
**Hint (if stuck):** [Partial answer or pointer]
**Full answer:** Reveal only after the user has either (a) proposed an
answer (right or wrong), (b) explicitly asked for the answer ("just tell
me", "I give up"), or (c) answered a clarifying hint. Do not reveal after
a pure clarification question ("what do you mean by X?") — respond to
the clarification first.
```

### Depth Adaptation

Scale detail to the session depth chosen in setup:

| Element | Quick Walkthrough | Full Tutorial | Deep Mastery |
|---------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Why this matters | Brief | Detailed | With alternatives |
| Technical concept | Skip if obvious | Include when a new concept appears | Include trade-offs |
| Code examples | Minimal | From codebase | Multiple approaches |
| Exercises | None | Optional | Required |
| Edge cases | Skip | Mention | Explore |

## INTERACTION REQUIREMENTS

### Communication Rules
1. **Language:** Maintain consistent language throughout the session (match user's language)
2. **Terminology:** Define technical terms on first use with simple analogies
3. Pacing: Ask the user to confirm at each numbered step before moving to
   the next step. Reason: without a pause, the user can't execute the
   action themselves, which defeats the "learn by doing" goal.
   Mid-step clarifying questions (asking what error they saw, which option
   they picked) are fine and don't count as "proceeding".
4. **Questions:** Encourage questions at each step — learning is the priority, not speed

### Error Handling
- Read error output carefully, use Grep/Glob to locate the source if needed
- Explain what went wrong in simple terms (what the error message actually means)
- Provide the fix with explanation of why it works
- Use errors as teaching moments — "This failed because..." builds deeper understanding than always succeeding

## PROGRESSION TRACKING

### Session Management
- Use TodoWrite to track steps — gives the user a visual progress indicator
- Number all steps sequentially (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- Remind user of overall progress every 3-5 steps
- Reference previous steps when building on concepts ("Remember in Step 2 when we...")

### Complexity Scaling
- Start with simplest concepts
- Introduce complexity gradually
- Connect new concepts to previously learned ones
- For Deep Mastery sessions: provide "bonus learning" notes and exercises

### Context continuity
Long sessions (Full Tutorial, Deep Mastery) can span many turns. If
context is compacted mid-session, do not wrap the session up early —
the learning plan from SESSION SETUP is the source of truth. Before
any summarisation pass, update the session's resume file under `docs/learning/`
with the current step number, chosen depth, and pending bonus-learning notes so the
session can pick up from the correct step. Create that resume artifact only when a
long session needs cross-turn continuity or the user asks for resumable notes.

## SESSION CAPTURE

After the session completes, offer to save learning notes for future reference.

`AskUserQuestion`: "Want me to save these notes for future reference?"
- **If yes** → Create `docs/learning/sbs-YYYY-MM-DD-[topic-slug].md` with:
  ```markdown
  # Learning Notes: [Topic]
  **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
  **Depth:** [Quick/Full/Deep]

  ## Key Concepts
  - [Concept 1]: [1-sentence explanation]
  - [Concept 2]: [1-sentence explanation]

  ## Steps Summary
  1. [Step title] — [what and why, condensed]
  2. ...

  ## Quick Reference
  [Commands, code snippets, or patterns to remember — copy-paste ready]

  ## Further Reading
  - [Links to docs, files, or resources referenced during the session]
  ```
- **If no** → Skip — the conversation itself is the artifact

## NEXT STEPS

After the learning session, offer a natural handoff based on what the user learned:

`AskUserQuestion`: "What would you like to do next?"
- **"Apply this to a real task"** → Invoke `/si` with relevant task context
- **"Explore this topic more broadly"** → Invoke `/brainstorm` with the topic
- **"Deep dive into the docs"** → Invoke `/deep-research` with the topic
- **"I'm good, thanks"** → Wrap up with a 1-sentence recap of what was covered

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] The requested topic is covered at the chosen depth
- [ ] Each planned step ends with user confirmation, an intentional skip, or an explicit blocker
- [ ] Key concepts are transferable: the user can explain or adapt the pattern
- [ ] Learning notes are offered and saved only if the user wants them

Do not end on an explanation alone when the user asked to work through a task: finish the
current step's user-visible outcome or record the blocker and next action.
