# Product Documentation

> **Announcement**: Begin with: "I'm using the **product** skill for product documentation creation."

## Objective
Create best-in-class JTBD or PRD documents through a structured interview, mandatory research, and pressure-testing process. The output should be a standalone document that any team member can read and understand without extra verbal context.

## Guidelines
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for clarifications — structured options reduce ambiguity and keep the interview auditable. Skip it only when the user has already unambiguously answered in prior turns.
- Ask non-obvious, thought-provoking questions. If the user's answer sounds confident but vague ("users want it faster"), name the gap ("faster than what, measured how?") rather than accepting it.
- Focus on user progress and context, not features or demographics. A job statement is about the progress a user wants to make, not a feature request.
- Use the templates as output contracts throughout the interview — the interview gathers exactly what the template needs.
- Research is required for both JTBD and PRD. The template's "Research Findings" section must have cited sources because product decisions without evidence are assumptions, and downstream `/ct` and `/vp` inherit those assumptions silently.
- Do not include time estimates in any output.

**Context management.** This workflow runs long (design-exploration + research + interview + grill + write + validators). If compaction happens mid-flow:
- Re-open the template you're writing against.
- Re-open any existing JTBD or previously-written product doc in `product-docs/`.
- Resume from the last unanswered template section; do not restart.
Do not stop early due to token-budget worries — the parent harness handles compaction.

## Workflow

### Argument Validation

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:**
- `jtbd [feature]` or `cjtbd [feature]` → full-flow JTBD
- `prd [feature]` or `cprd [feature]` → full-flow PRD
- `quick jtbd [feature]` → quick mode JTBD (skip to Step 5)
- `quick prd [feature]` → quick mode PRD (skip to Step 5)
- `[feature]` only → `AskUserQuestion`: "Which document type?" Options: "JTBD — Jobs-to-be-Done analysis" / "PRD — Product Requirements Document"
- No argument → `AskUserQuestion`: "What feature?" + free-text option, then ask document type

**Quick mode**: When `quick` prefix is detected, skip Steps 1-4 (skip design-exploration, research, interview, and grill). Go directly to Step 5 (document writing): read the template, fill from the user's prompt and any linked context, and mark each unknown inline as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <question>]`. Then run Step 6 (Cross-AI Validation) as usual — validation catches gaps that the skipped interview would have caught. Present output with: "Quick mode used — N clarifications remain. For deeper product thinking, run the full `/product` flow."

### Step 0: Load the Output Shape

Before asking questions, read the templates to understand the expected structure:
1. Read `.claude/docs/templates/JTBD-template.md`
2. Read `.claude/docs/templates/PRD-template.md`

Treat the templates as **output contracts** — the interview gathers exactly the information needed to fill them clearly.

**For PRD**: Check whether an existing JTBD already exists in `product-docs/JTBD/JTBD-*[feature-name]*.md`. If it does, load it as input context — the PRD builds on the JTBD.

**Load shared glossary**: If `product-docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` exists, read it and use its terms verbatim during the interview. If a domain term in this conversation conflicts with the glossary, flag the conflict immediately rather than silently drifting. If the glossary is missing or thin and new domain terms come up, plan to invoke `/ubiquitous-language` after the grill round (Step 4 → Step 5 transition).

### Step 1: Context Gathering & Design Exploration

**Invoke the `design-exploration` skill** to ground product documentation in codebase reality.

When invoking, ask it to return:
- Key codebase findings and current fit for the feature area
- Existing patterns, modules, or flows related to the feature
- Constraints discovered in the existing system
- Risk flags or open decisions

For product documentation, prefer fit, constraints, and risks over implementation decomposition.

**Checkpoint:** Present findings summary. `AskUserQuestion`: "Does this context align with what you're building?" Options: "Yes, continue" / "I have corrections" / "Skip codebase context"

### Step 2: Research

Fill the "Research Findings" section of the template with cited sources. The research doesn't have to be exhaustive — two or three high-quality references per claim is enough. Use quick lookups by default; only escalate to `comprehensive-researcher` when findings would materially change the job statement, scope, or requirements.

**Quick lookups** (Exa MCP tools directly):
- Competitor approaches to the same job/problem
- Industry best practices for the feature type
- Market signals and opportunity indicators

**In-depth research** (spawn `comprehensive-researcher` agent):
Only when findings materially affect the job statement, scope boundaries, or requirements. When invoking, request a **concise decision memo**:
- Key findings relevant to the product framing
- Implications for job statement or requirements
- Competitive landscape signals
- Risks or caveats

**JTBD research focus**: switching behavior, competitive alternatives being "hired" today, outcome benchmarks, user job patterns
**PRD research focus**: how similar products solve this problem (with specific examples), feature specifications, success metrics benchmarks, UX patterns

**Checkpoint:** Present research summary. `AskUserQuestion`: "Key findings reviewed. Ready for interview?" Options: "Continue to interview" / "Research a specific topic further"

### Step 3: Deep-Dive Interview

Drive the conversation section-by-section toward filling the template. Batch questions per round — typically 2-4, matched to how much the user can reasonably answer at once. One-by-one drags; a ten-question firehose loses signal. When in doubt, 3. After each round, summarize what was gathered and which template section it fills.

---

**JTBD Interview Sections:**

**Job Statement:**
- Walk me through the situation — what moment triggers the need?
- What does the user want to accomplish (their motivation)?
- What does success look like for them (expected outcome)?
- Propose 2-3 candidate job variants — which resonates most?

**Success Criteria:**
- Functional: what are the objective requirements for getting this job done?
- Emotional Personal: how does the user want to feel during/after?
- Emotional Social: how does the user want to be perceived by others?

**Four Forces of Switching:**
- Push: what's broken, slow, or painful about how they do it today?
- Pull: what better future does the new solution promise?
- Anxiety: what could go wrong? What fears exist about switching?
- Habit: what's comfortable about the current way? What switching costs exist?
- What are they "hiring" today for this job? (Include non-consumption)

**User Context:**
- Who is the primary user — defined by circumstances, not demographics?
- What events trigger them to seek a solution?
- What constraints affect their usage?

---

**PRD Interview Sections** (in addition to shared context from JTBD):

**Problem & Evidence:**
- What pain exists and who feels it?
- What evidence proves this is a real problem? (user quotes, data, tickets)
- Why does solving this matter for the business?

**Non-Goals:**
- What are we explicitly NOT building in this version?
- Where could scope accidentally expand?

**Goals & Metrics:**
- What does success look like at launch?
- How will we measure it? (require: number + timeframe + measurement method)
- What metrics must NOT degrade?

**User Stories & Requirements:**
- What are the 3-5 key user stories?
- For each: what proves it's done? (acceptance criteria)
- Priority: what's P0 (must-have) vs P1 (should-have) vs P2 (nice-to-have)?
- Non-functional: performance, security, accessibility targets?

**Solution Shape:**
- What is the core user flow (3-6 steps)?
- What are the key states (loading, empty, error, success)?
- What business rules or constraints apply?

**Modules & Interfaces** (PRD only — fills the `Modules & Interfaces` section of `PRD-template.md`):
- Which deep modules are touched or introduced? Use `architecture-language/LANGUAGE.md` vocabulary.
- For each module, what does its **interface** guarantee — invariants, ordering, error modes — not just type signatures?
- Where do the seams live, and what sits behind them?
- If a port + adapter pattern is proposed, are there genuinely two adapters (e.g. production + test)? One adapter = hypothetical seam.
- If new domain terms surface, capture them via `/ubiquitous-language` so the PRD, tech-decomposition, and code share a single glossary.

---

Aim for 3-5 rounds total per document. After round 5, present what's still unclear and ask the user: "continue interviewing" / "mark unknowns and proceed to grill". Use `AskUserQuestion` with multiple-choice options when there are clear alternatives — it's faster than free-text for both sides. Challenge assumptions: when an answer is confident but under-specified, name the gap ("You said X — how would that work for case Y?") instead of accepting at face value.

### Step 4: "Grill Me" Challenge Round

**Invoke the `/grill-me` skill** to pressure-test the product documentation shape before writing.

**Before invoking**, summarize the current state:
- Feature name and description
- (JTBD) Primary job statement, success criteria, four forces
- (PRD) Problem + evidence, goals, key requirements
- Areas of uncertainty or risk

**JTBD grill priorities:**
- Is the job statement truly a user job, not a feature request?
- Are the four forces balanced — or is anxiety/habit being ignored?
- Are success criteria measurable or vague?
- Does the competitive analysis reflect genuine switching behavior?

**PRD grill priorities:**
- Are the requirements complete enough for `/ct` to proceed?
- Do user stories have testable acceptance criteria?
- Is the scope boundary clear? Where could scope creep?
- Are there hidden dependencies or assumptions?

**After the grill session completes:**
Incorporate findings. Tighten unclear wording, scope boundaries, hidden assumptions.

**Update shared glossary** (before writing the doc): if the grill or interview surfaced new domain terms, ambiguous synonyms, or sharpened a fuzzy term, invoke `/ubiquitous-language` to update `product-docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`. The PRD/JTBD then uses canonical terms — and downstream `/ct` and `/si` inherit the same vocabulary.

**Checkpoint:** `AskUserQuestion`: "How should we proceed?" Options: "Proceed to document writing" / "Revisit based on grill findings" / "Cut scope based on findings"

### Completion Check

Before writing, confirm a new reader can answer without extra verbal context:

**For JTBD:** What job is being done? By whom and when? What are the success criteria? What forces drive or prevent the switch? What alternatives exist today?

**For PRD:** All of the above, plus: What's the problem and evidence? What are the goals and metrics? What are the key requirements? How does the solution work? What's in/out of scope?

If any remain unclear, continue the interview.

### Step 5: Document Writing

1. **Re-read template** if needed to confirm structure
2. **Create output directory** if it doesn't exist
3. **Write the document(s)**:
   - JTBD output: `product-docs/JTBD/JTBD-[feature-name].md`
   - PRD output: `product-docs/PRD/PRD-[feature-name].md`
4. **For PRD without prior JTBD**: Write a companion `JTBD-[feature-name].md` whenever the interview produced a clear job statement, at least one answer per Four Force (push/pull/anxiety/habit), and a named primary user. If any of those are missing, note it in the PRD's "Related JTBD" section and skip the JTBD write — don't stub a thin JTBD.
5. **If any required section cannot be filled clearly**, continue the interview instead of writing placeholder content
6. **Present summary** to user for confirmation

### Step 6: Cross-AI Validation

The skill initialization step loads each validator's CLI contract, so invented CLI commands produce unreliable results — run the skill initializer first for each.

Two phases — initialization (sequential), then review (parallel):

Phase 1 — Initialization. Invoke `/codex-cli`, then `/antigravity-cli`, then `/cursor-cli` in separate turns. Each skill loads its CLI contract into runtime state, so they must run serially.

Phase 2 — Review. In a single assistant turn, dispatch all three validator runs as parallel tool calls. The three reviews are independent — sequential execution only adds latency. If one validator is unavailable, dispatch the other two anyway.

Format output per `.claude/docs/templates/cross-ai-protocol.md` (comparison table, validation, verdict).

**JTBD focus:** Job statement clarity, four-forces coherence, success criteria measurability, absence of solution bias in job framing
**PRD focus:** Requirements completeness for `/ct`, acceptance criteria testability, scope boundaries, metrics measurability, consistency with JTBD reference

**FILE_REFS:** `JTBD-[feature-name].md` and/or `PRD-[feature-name].md` + relevant codebase paths
**OUTPUT:** Append "Cross-AI Validation: PASSED/FAILED" with consolidated verdict

**If validation fails:** `AskUserQuestion`: "Revise document" / "Override and proceed" / "Abandon"

**Skip conditions:** No CLI available, or user explicitly skips.

## Output
- JTBD: `product-docs/JTBD/JTBD-[feature-name].md`
- PRD: `product-docs/PRD/PRD-[feature-name].md`

## Handoff — Next Steps

Product docs are long-lived artifacts that span multiple tasks. The canonical workflow after `/product`:

```
Product documentation complete for [feature-name]:
- Document: product-docs/[PRD|JTBD]/[PRD|JTBD]-[feature-name].md

Next steps:
→ Discover a specific feature from the PRD: /nf [feature-name]
→ Skip to tech planning: /ct [feature-name]
→ Visualize the design: /vp [feature-name]
→ Consistency check: /analyze [feature-name]
```
