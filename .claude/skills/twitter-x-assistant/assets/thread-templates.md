## Contrarian Thread Template

```
Tweet 1: "Everyone says you need X. They're wrong."

Tweet 2: "Here's what actually works:"

Tweet 3: [Contrarian insight #1 with proof]

Tweet 4: [Contrarian insight #2 with proof]

Tweet 5: [Contrarian insight #3 with proof]

Tweet 6: [Why the common advice fails]

Tweet 7: [Real-world example/case study]

Tweet 8: "So stop doing X, start doing Y"

Tweet 9: "Your turn: What's a myth you've busted?"
```

**Example:**
```
Tweet 1: "Everyone says you need viral tweets to grow. They're wrong."

Tweet 2: "Here's what actually builds a loyal audience:"

Tweet 3: "Consistency > Virality. 1 viral tweet brings followers who don't stick. Daily value brings followers who engage."

Tweet 4: "Engagement > Creation. The 70/30 rule isn't popular advice, but it works. My growth 3x'd when I prioritized replies."

Tweet 5: "Niche > Broad. 'Creator tips' gets lost in noise. 'Notion tips for designers' attracts engaged followers."

Tweet 6: "Why viral advice fails: Chasing virality makes you create for the algorithm, not your audience. That's backwards."

Tweet 7: "Case study: I had 3 viral tweets (100K+ views each). Got 500 followers who never engaged. Built 10K through daily engagement. Those 10K still reply to every post."

Tweet 8: "So stop chasing viral moments, start building real relationships."

Tweet 9: "Your turn: What's a growth myth you've busted? ⬇️"
