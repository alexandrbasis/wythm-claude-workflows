# Parallel Implementation Orchestrator

> **Announcement**: Begin with: "I'm using the **parallelization** skill for parallel implementation orchestration."

Spawn scoped `developer-agent` workers in isolated git worktrees to implement independent work items simultaneously, then merge results back into the working tree.

## When to Parallelize

Parallelization helps when a task has multiple acceptance criteria that are genuinely independent — different modules, different files, no shared state. The time savings are significant (N items in ~1x time instead of Nx time), but the merge overhead adds complexity. Use this decision matrix:

| Scenario | Parallelize? |
|----------|-------------|
| Steps touch different modules/directories | Yes |
| Independent test suites for different services | Yes |
| Steps modify the same files | No — sequential |
| Step N depends on Step N-1's output | No — sequential |
| Database migrations (order matters) | No — sequential |
| Steps share test fixtures or DB state | No — sequential |
| Only 1 parallelizable item | No — not worth the overhead |

**Max concurrency**: Spawn at most **4 workers** simultaneously. Beyond that, API throughput and context quality degrade.

If a scenario is not covered by the matrix, default to sequential and state
your reasoning in one sentence before proceeding. Parallelization is an
optimization, not a requirement — when independence is uncertain,
sequential is the safe choice.

## Pre-flight Checks

Before spawning any workers, verify:

1. **Classify working-tree changes**: inspect `git status` before dispatch. If task files or required
   inputs are dirty, do not send them to workers branched from `HEAD`; fall back to sequential
   in-place execution or ask the user to preserve the changes. If only unrelated files are dirty,
   leave them untouched and proceed with isolated workers. Never require an unrelated commit or
   stash solely to use this optimization.
2. **Task document exists**: The task doc must be readable and have identifiable work items.
3. **Independence verified**: Confirm selected items don't share files. Quick check: list the expected file paths for each item and look for overlaps.

## Workflow

### 1) Identify parallelizable work items

**Wave detection (preferred)**: Check the task document for wave annotations (e.g., `— **Wave 1**`, `— **Wave 2**`). If present, group steps by wave number. Execute all same-wave steps in parallel, then advance to the next wave. This is the preferred path since wave annotations are assigned by `/ct` during planning when the author has full context.

**Fallback (no waves)**: Read the task document. List all acceptance criteria / work items. Select only those that pass the decision matrix above.

Announce the plan:

> "Parallelizing items [2, 3, 5] (Wave 1) — they touch independent modules. Items [1, 4] (Wave 2) will run after Wave 1 completes."

### 2) Spawn workers in worktrees

Each worker runs in an **isolated git worktree** via the Agent tool's `isolation: "worktree"` parameter. This gives each worker its own copy of the repo — no file conflicts possible.

Spawn every worker in **the same assistant message** — do not default to
sequential Agent calls. True concurrency only happens when all Agent tool
calls are in one turn; splitting them across turns serializes the work and
defeats the purpose of this skill. When calls have no dependencies, batch
them; never spawn one, wait, then spawn the next.

```
Agent tool call 1:
  subagent_type: "developer-agent"
  isolation: "worktree"
  prompt: |
    Implement acceptance criterion [N] for the task at [task_path].

    Inputs:
    - task_document_path: [task_document_path]
    - criterion_number: [N]
    - git_writes_approved: false

    Constraints:
    - Scope: criterion [N]. Make the edits needed to satisfy it (including
      required supporting imports, types, fixtures). Do not expand scope into
      other criteria, unrelated refactors, or drive-by cleanups.
    - Follow TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR) inside scope — canonical: `.claude/skills/tdd/SKILL.md`. Vertical slices only.
    - Do NOT create git commits — just make the changes
    - Do NOT edit shared task documents
    - Return a summary with: status, files_changed, test_results, and any notes

Agent tool call 2 (same message):
  subagent_type: "developer-agent"
  isolation: "worktree"
  prompt: |
    (same structure, different criterion)
```

Anti-pattern: do not call one Agent, wait for its result, then call the
next. All N spawn calls go in one assistant message, period. If you find
yourself about to issue a single Agent call when multiple items were
selected, stop and batch them.

**Why worktrees?** Without isolation, multiple agents editing files simultaneously in the same directory would create race conditions and corrupted files. Worktrees give each agent a complete, independent copy of the repo. When the agent finishes, its worktree path and branch are returned in the result — you use these to cherry-pick the changes back.

### 3) Consolidate results

As workers complete, collect their results. Each worktree agent returns:
- The **worktree path** and **branch name** where changes were made
- A summary of what was implemented

For each completed worker:

```bash
# 1. Review what the worker changed
git -C <worktree_path> diff HEAD

# 2. If changes look correct, create a patch and apply it
git -C <worktree_path> diff HEAD > /tmp/worker-crit-N.patch
git apply /tmp/worker-crit-N.patch

# 3. Or, if the worker committed (git_writes_approved=true):
git merge <worktree_branch> --no-ff -m "feat(scope): implement criterion N"
```

**Conflict handling**: If `git apply` fails with conflicts, the items weren't truly independent. Apply the non-conflicting patches first, then handle the conflicting one manually in the main working tree.

### 4) Run validation

After all patches are applied, run the project's quality checks. Detect the project area and its
working directory from the task and repository scripts before running commands; replace every
placeholder and keep each package invocation in its own explicit cwd. Do not claim validation from
an unresolved root-level command.

**Project verification:**
```bash
{{LINT_CMD}} && {{TYPECHECK_CMD}} && {{TEST_CMD}}
```

If validation fails, identify which worker's changes caused the issue and fix in the main working tree.

### 5) Update task document

After all workers' changes are applied and validated, update the task document **once**:
- Check off completed criteria
- Add changelog entries for each parallelized item
- Note which items were parallelized (useful for reviewers)

Workers must not edit shared task documents — this is the orchestrator's job, to avoid merge conflicts in docs.

### Context note
Worker results accumulate in this conversation. Context may be
auto-compacted between waves. Before starting the next wave, re-read the
task document to reconstruct scope, and only persist between waves what
you will actually need (diffs applied, validation status). Do not stop a
multi-wave run because context feels full — compaction is handled for you.

## Safety Rules

- **Git writes require explicit user approval** — workers default to `git_writes_approved: false`
- **Task docs are orchestrator-owned** — workers return notes, orchestrator updates docs
- **No scope creep** — each worker implements exactly one criterion, nothing more

## Output

After consolidation, report:

- Which criteria were parallelized
- Worker summaries (status, files changed, test results)
- Any conflicts discovered and how they were resolved
- What remains to be done sequentially
- Validation results (lint, types, tests)
