# Start Review

> **Announcement**: Begin with: "I'm using the **sr** skill for universal code review."

Universal review entrypoint for task paths, PRs, branches, explicit ranges, and local working-tree drafts. Resolve the review target first, then only run checks supported by the evidence you actually have.

## When to Use
- Pre-merge code review
- "review this PR"
- "review this branch"
- "review my changes"
- "is this ready to merge?"
- Task review when a task directory or spec exists

## When NOT to Use
- Addressing review comments -> `/prc`
- General codebase exploration -> `/code-analysis`
- Implementation-plan review -> `/rip`

## STEP 1: Resolve Review Target

- Task path -> `task`
- PR URL or PR number -> `pr`
- Explicit git range -> `range`
- Branch name -> `branch`
- No arguments:
  1. If staged, unstaged, or untracked changes exist -> `working-tree`
  2. Else if current branch differs from resolved base -> `branch`
  3. Else ask what to review

## STEP 2: Detect Capabilities

Record these fields before dispatching reviewers:
- `has_task_doc`
- `has_spec`
- `has_committed_snapshot`
- `can_run_verification`
- `review_scope`

Rules:
- `task` mode may use task docs and spec compliance
- `pr`, `branch`, and `range` modes do not require task docs
- `working-tree` mode never requires a clean tree
- set `has_committed_snapshot = false` for `working-tree`; set it from resolved SHAs for committed modes
- Never claim spec compliance when no spec artifact exists
- PR descriptions or issue text do not count as spec unless the user explicitly says to treat them as the review baseline
- Cross-AI validation and Linear syncing are optional follow-ups, not default gates

## STEP 3: Resolve Base and Diff Context

Prefer base in this order:
1. PR base branch
2. Task-documented base branch
3. Current branch upstream
4. `main`
5. `master`

Compute diff context once and share it with all reviewers:
- `changed_files`
- `full_diff`
- `review_mode`
- `base_ref`
- `head_ref`
- `has_spec`

Diff rules:
- `task`, `pr`, `branch`, `range`: use committed diff from the resolved base or explicit range
- `working-tree`: use staged plus unstaged local diff, include untracked files in `changed_files`, set `base_ref = HEAD`, and set `head_ref = working-tree`
- Exclude generated files and lockfiles unless the user explicitly wants them reviewed

Do NOT force `main...HEAD` onto every review mode.

## STEP 4: Choose Scope

Use `quick` only when ALL are true:
- `<= 3` changed files
- `<= 50` diff lines
- no auth, migrations, infra, build-system, or shared framework changes

Otherwise use `full`.

**Deep (thermo) scope (`/sr deep`):** opt-in structural-quality tier. `deep` runs everything `full`
does **plus** the `structural-quality-reviewer` (STEP 5.3). It is never auto-selected — only the user
invokes it via `/sr deep`.

**Auto-suggest deep:** after resolving scope, if the diff crosses any structural threshold — a changed
file `> 1000` lines, `> 15` changed files, `> 600` changed lines, or a module rename/move — and the user
did not request `deep`, add a one-line recommendation to the review output (alongside the STEP 10 QA
recommendation): `Deep structural review recommended: <trigger>. Run /sr deep.` This is a recommendation,
not a blocker — continue with `full`.

**Full-feature scope option (`--scope=feature`):** When reviewing Phase N of a multi-phase task and the task directory contains earlier phases, optionally include the full feature diff (all phases from the earliest base commit to HEAD). Flag files changed in earlier phases but not in the current phase as **integration surface** — these are where cross-phase bugs hide. Use this when the current phase integrates with prior phases or when the task doc mentions cross-phase dependencies.

## STEP 5: Review Pipeline

`deep` is a superset of `full`: apply every `full`-scope rule below, then add the structural pass (5.3).

### 5.1 Optional Spec Gate

Run `spec-compliance-reviewer` only when `has_spec = true`.

If no spec exists, write:
`Skipped - no task/spec artifact available.`

### 5.2 Core Reviewers

Always run:
- `security-code-reviewer`
- `code-quality-reviewer`

Run `senior-architecture-reviewer` when:
- scope is `full`, or
- boundaries or dependencies changed, or
- new modules, services, or interfaces were introduced

### 5.3 Extended Reviewers

In `full` scope, also run:
- `test-coverage-reviewer`
- `documentation-accuracy-reviewer`
- `performance-reviewer`

In `deep` scope, additionally run `structural-quality-reviewer` — a whole-module structural audit
(details in its agent file). It writes to `<!-- SECTION:structural-quality -->`. Never run it in `quick`
or `full`.

### 5.4 Targeted Review Passes & Pattern Propagation

Orchestrator-owned inline checks (not subagents) plus a sibling-scan procedure. The trigger table and
per-pass checklists — error-path, integration-seams, cross-surface entity — and the pattern-propagation
procedure live in **`references/review-passes.md`**. Read it now when the diff matches any trigger, run
the matching pass, and add findings to `key-findings`.

For every skipped reviewer, write a one-line reason in that section.

## STEP 6: Verification Policy

Verification is evidence, not a prerequisite for starting review.

- `task`: prefer verification commands from the task doc; otherwise run narrow package checks
- `pr`, `branch`, `range`: run the smallest repo-appropriate checks for touched packages when safe
- `working-tree`: run only safe local checks; do NOT block review on a dirty tree

If verification is skipped or partial, record it. Missing verification is not passing verification.

## STEP 7: Prepare CR File

There is always exactly **one** Code Review file per review target. Compute `cr_file_path`:

- `task` -> `<task-directory>/code-review-[feature-name].md`
  - Extract `[feature-name]` from the task directory name by stripping the `task-YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix (e.g., `task-2026-04-02-operations-center` → `operations-center`). If the directory does not match this prefix pattern, use the full directory name as the feature name.
- `working-tree` -> `.claude/reviews/code-review-working-tree-[current-branch].md` (or `code-review-working-tree.md` if detached)
- all other non-task modes -> `.claude/reviews/code-review-[target].md` (create `.claude/reviews/` if missing)

**Sanitization:** Replace any `/` or spaces in `[current-branch]` or `[target]` with hyphens before constructing the filename.

**If `cr_file_path` already exists** (re-review): reuse it. Clear all `<!-- SECTION:xxx -->` contents back to placeholder text so agents write fresh findings. Do NOT create a second file.

**Legacy migration:** If `cr_file_path` does not exist, also check for a legacy `Code Review.md` (task mode) or `Code Review - *.md` (other modes) in the same directory. If found, rename it to the new `cr_file_path` convention before reusing.

**If no file exists at all**: create it by writing the template from `.claude/docs/templates/code-review-template.md`.

## STEP 8: Dispatch Agents

Pass `cr_file_path` to every agent so they use **File Mode**.

Dispatch **all agents selected in STEP 5 in a single turn** — issue every Agent tool call in the same assistant message. The agents write to disjoint `<!-- SECTION:xxx -->` markers in `cr_file_path`, so there are no ordering dependencies (in `deep` scope this batch also includes `structural-quality-reviewer`, writing to its own `structural-quality` markers). Each agent already receives the same `full_diff` / `changed_files` context computed once in STEP 3, so the tool calls are independent and safe to batch. Do not dispatch one, wait for it to finish, then dispatch the next; that serializes a parallel workload.

Each agent reads → edits its own section markers only; no agent touches another agent's section.

If an agent fails or times out, write a fallback note into its section:
`*Review skipped — [agent-name] did not complete.*`

Once every dispatched agent has finished, proceed to STEP 9.

## STEP 9: Write Verdict

The orchestrator writes the remaining sections that agents do not own:

- `review-context` — fill from STEP 2 capabilities
- `summary` — synthesize a 2-5 sentence note from agent findings
- `verdict` — one of the verdicts below
- `key-findings` — consolidate actionable findings from all agents. Include every CRITICAL and MAJOR regardless of confidence. For MINOR/INFO, include items marked `confidence: high`; drop or collapse `confidence: low` MINOR/INFO into a single "Other low-confidence notes" bullet. Order by severity, then confidence. **Structural `[OPPORTUNITY]` findings** (deep scope) go in a dedicated "Structural Opportunities" sub-block — they surface prominently but do NOT count toward the verdict; route them to `/prc` or a follow-up task.
- `coverage` — record what was reviewed and what was skipped
- `verification` — record commands run and results
- `metadata` — changed files, diff source, reviewers invoked

Use the **Edit tool** to write each orchestrator section into its markers in `cr_file_path`. Do NOT overwrite the entire file — agents already wrote their sections.

Verdicts:
- `DRAFT REVIEW`: working-tree review or no immutable snapshot
- `APPROVED`: committed snapshot, sufficient coverage, `0 critical`, `0 major`
- `APPROVED WITH NOTES`: committed snapshot, `0 critical`, `0 major`, but verification or coverage is partial
- `NEEDS FIXES`: any critical or major finding (including structural CRITICAL/MAJOR from deep scope; `[OPPORTUNITY]` findings never trigger this)

Never return `APPROVED` for an uncommitted working-tree draft.

## STEP 10: QA Gate Recommendation

After the verdict is written, check whether the diff affects user-facing rendering — any file that produces DOM output, styling, or routing state. Use this list as a seed, not a limit: `.svelte`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.html`, `.astro`, `.mdx`, CSS/SCSS, component stories, route files. When in doubt, treat it as UI. If it qualifies, append a **QA recommendation** to the review file:

> **QA recommended**: This review includes UI changes. Static code review cannot catch runtime layout, navigation, or user-flow issues. Consider running browser-based QA (manual or automated) before merging.

This is a recommendation, not a blocker. It surfaces the gap between "code looks correct" and "feature works correctly."

## Operating Reminders

Three gates are worth re-stating because mis-handling them corrupts the review file:

- One CR file per review target — reuse and clear existing markers instead of creating a second file (see STEP 7).
- Pass `cr_file_path` to every dispatched agent so they write in File Mode (see STEP 8).
- Use Edit, not Write, on `cr_file_path` after agents have populated their sections — a full overwrite destroys their work (see STEP 9).
