# Analyze: Cross-Artifact Consistency Check

> **Announcement**: Begin with: "I'm using the **analyze** skill for cross-artifact consistency checking."

## Purpose

Verify that the tech decomposition OUTPUT of `/ct` is fully aligned with the spec INPUT (discovery/JTBD/PRD docs). Catches drift between what was specified and what was planned — BEFORE implementation begins.

**This skill is read-only.** It reads and reports — no file writes, no agents, no code changes.

---

## Step 1: Locate Artifacts

Find the task directory and its documents:

1. **If argument provided**: match against `tasks/task-*[argument]*/`
2. **If no argument**: list recent task directories, ask user to select

**Required artifacts** (at least one spec + one plan):

| Type | Files to look for |
|------|-------------------|
| **Spec** (input) | `discovery-*.md`, `JTBD-*.md` in task directory; `PRD-*.md` in `docs/product-docs/PRD/`; `JTBD-*.md` in `docs/product-docs/JTBD/` |
| **Plan** (output) | `tech-decomposition-*.md` (or `phase-*/tech-decomposition-*.md` if split) |

**If spec docs are missing**: Report "No spec documents found — cannot verify alignment. This task was created without /nf or /product documentation." Verdict: `SKIPPED`.

**If tech decomposition is missing**: Report "No tech decomposition found — run /ct first." Verdict: `SKIPPED`.

When an argument identifies a task, prefer documents matching that task and feature name;
do not load unrelated PRDs or JTBDs merely because they exist elsewhere in the repository.

---

## Step 2: Extract Requirements

Read all spec documents and extract a numbered list of requirements:

- From **discovery docs**: walk every top-level heading. Extract requirements from `How It Works`, `In Scope`, `Key Requirements`, `Constraints` (and their older equivalents: Functional/Non-Functional Requirements, UI/UX Specifications, acceptance scenarios). For any heading you are unsure about, include it in a `[UNCERTAIN-SOURCE]` note rather than skipping.
- From **JTBD docs**: Core Needs, Desired Outcomes
- From **PRD docs**: Functional Requirements, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria

Assign each requirement an ID: `REQ-001`, `REQ-002`, etc.

**Also extract**: any unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers — these are immediate blockers.

---

## Step 3: Extract Test Cases

Read the tech decomposition's **Test Plan** section. Extract all test cases with their Given/When/Then definitions.

Assign each test case an ID: `TEST-001`, `TEST-002`, etc.

---

## Step 4: Extract Implementation Steps

Read the tech decomposition's **Implementation Steps** section. Extract all steps and sub-steps.

Note any existing `[REQ-XXX]` traceability tags already present on steps.

---

## Step 5: Build Traceability Matrix

Map the three dimensions:

```
Requirement (REQ-XXX) → Test Case (TEST-XXX) → Implementation Step (Step X.X)
```

For each requirement, determine:
- Does at least one test case verify this requirement?
- Does at least one implementation step fulfill this requirement?

For each implementation step, determine:
- Does it trace back to a requirement, either by explicit `[REQ-XXX]` tag or by covering one or more sub-clauses of a requirement? If it only covers part of a requirement, flag the uncovered portion as a separate `[UNCOVERED]` finding for that sub-clause.
- Does it have an associated test?

---

## Step 6: Flag Gaps (coverage pass)

Report every gap you find, including low-signal ones. Do not suppress findings based on severity at this stage — a separate verification step will filter. Annotate each finding with a tag and a severity guess:

| Tag | Meaning | Default severity |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `[UNCOVERED]` | Requirement has no test case | Major |
| `[UNTESTED]` | Implementation step has no associated test | Minor |
| `[SCOPE CREEP]` | Implementation step maps to no requirement | Major |
| `[CONFLICT]` | Requirement contradicts a tech decision or another requirement | Critical |
| `[UNRESOLVED]` | `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` marker not yet resolved | Critical |

## Step 6a: Verdict (filter pass)

Apply severity gating only when computing the final verdict, not when collecting findings.

---

## Step 7: Report & Verdict

Present the report to the user:

```markdown
## Consistency Analysis: [Task Name]

### Traceability Matrix

| REQ | Description | Test | Step | Status |
|-----|-------------|------|------|--------|
| REQ-001 | [brief] | TEST-001 | Step 1.1 | Covered |
| REQ-002 | [brief] | — | Step 2.1 | [UNCOVERED] |
| REQ-003 | [brief] | TEST-003 | — | [UNCOVERED] |
| — | — | — | Step 3.1 | [SCOPE CREEP] |

### Findings

- [UNCOVERED] REQ-002 "User can delete session" — no test case covers this requirement
- [SCOPE CREEP] Step 3.1 "Add caching layer" — no requirement references caching

### Verdict: ALIGNED | GAPS FOUND ([N] issues)

**Critical**: [count] | **Major**: [count] | **Minor**: [count]
```

**Verdict rules**:
- **ALIGNED**: 0 Critical, 0 Major gaps
- **GAPS FOUND**: Any Critical or Major gaps exist

**If GAPS FOUND**: Ask user via `AskUserQuestion`:
- **Fix gaps** — go back and update the tech decomposition
- **Acknowledge and proceed** — gaps are intentional or will be addressed later
- **Re-run /nf** — spec docs need revision first

Complete the read-only matrix, findings, counts, and verdict before asking this question.
The user's choice is a follow-up decision; it does not authorize this skill to edit the
specification or plan.
